   <h1> What Is Daylight Saving Time? </h1>
   <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px; font-family: sans-serif;"><b> Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of setting the clocks forward one hour from standard time during the summer months, and back again in the fall, in order to make better use of natural daylight.
   Daylight saving time (DST), also known as daylight savings time or daylight time (the United States and Canada), and summer time (United Kingdom, European Union, and some others),</b> is the practice of advancing clocks (typically by one hour) during warmer months so that darkness falls at a later clock time. The typical implementation of DST is to set clocks forward by one hour in the spring ("spring forward") and set clocks back by one hour in autumn ("fall back") to return to standard time. As a result, there is one 23-hour day in late winter or early spring and one 25-hour day in the autumn.
The idea to manipulate clocks was first proposed in 1784 by Benjamin Franklin. In a letter to the editor of The Journal of Paris, the American inventor and politician jokingly suggested it as a way to economize candle usage. However, in 1895, New Zealand entomologist and astronomer George Hudson seriously proposed the idea moving the clocks two hours every spring to the Wellington Philosophical Society, driven by his desire to have extra time to devote to collecting and examining insects. Though the idea did receive some serious consideration in 1907 when British resident William Willett presented it as a way to save energy, it was never implemented. The German Empire and

Many countries have used it at various times since then, particularly since the 1970s energy crisis. DST is generally not observed near the equator, where sunrise and sunset times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, parts of Australia observe it, while other parts do not, and the United States observes it, except Arizona (excepting Navajo Tribal lands, who conform to the national practice), and Hawaii, which do not. Only a minority of the world's population uses DST; Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.
